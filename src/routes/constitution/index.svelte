    <ol>
        <li>
            This is a DYNASTY Fantasy Football league. It requires commitment over multiple seasons. You’re in it for the long haul. Players remain on the same Franchise from one season to the next unless they are traded or released.
        </li>
        <li>
            Be active. Be involved. Set lineups. Propose trades. Respond to trades promptly. Send messages in group chat. It makes the experience better for everyone and increases league longevity.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roster & Scoring settings are fairly different from default settings. Make sure to read up on those sections below to be prepared.
        </li>
        <li>
            The league will be hosted on Sleeper. It is the best, free dynasty focused app for fantasy football on the market currently. Depending on the draft format, myfantasyleague may be used for the draft and exported.
        </li>
    </ol>


    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={a_2}>A.2 League Integrity</h3>
    
   <ol>
        <li>
            It is in the best interest of the league that all teams compete for all weeks of the year, when a team does not submit a competitive line up (resets each year):
            <ol>
                <li>
                    First Offense: Warning
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second Offense: Loss of 25% of total FAAB budget for the following season
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third Offense: Loss of 3rd round rookie pick (theirs, or other’s they own) or the latest draft pick they own, otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    4th Offense: Removal from league
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Noncompetitive means when an owner submits a lineup that includes:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Any player that is a Free Agent
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any player that is Suspended
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any player that is on Injured Reserve 
                </li>
                <li>
                    A lineup with less than required starters
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any player that is OUT for multiple weeks. 
                    <ul><li>
                        If a player gets downgraded to out on the same day of the game, that is allowed. If it becomes a trend then it may be looked at as an issue.
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The intent to lose a matchup on purpose (automatically elevates to 2nd offense)
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            It would be nice to see all owners return year to year; however we know that things happen so if an owner should choose not to return, the commissioner will find a replacement GM using whatever means necessary to keep the league stable.
        </li>
        <li>
            If a team is abandoned mid-season, the commissioner will assume control of setting lineups for the team until a new GM can be found. While under control of the commissioner, this team will be barred from making trades, and any monetary winnings it may make will be put towards the dynasty pool. GM’s taking over an orphaned team mid season are not expected to pay an additional buy in.
        </li>
        <li>
            When ownership of a franchise changes, the new owner will keep the same players held by the previous owner. The new GM will also keep the drafting position held by the previous owner.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some things that will not be tolerated at all are collusion, cheating and hacking. 
        </li>
        <li>
            All of these rules are set and any changes will require a vote for the next season only. Any GM can propose rules changes in the off-season. A ⅔ majority vote is required to make a rule change.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scoring is not subject to change, as it would cause changes of player values that owners would not have been expecting.
        </li>
    </ol>
    

    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={a_3}>A.3 Comissioner Responsibilities</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Because of the inability to account for all possible scenarios, the commissioner will assume a governing position for the league.
        </li>
        <li>
            The commissioner is responsible for interpreting league rules, settling league disputes, and handling day-to-day operations.
        </li>
        <li>
            The commissioner reserves the right to protect the integrity of the league, especially in cases of clear collusion, cheating, or intentional sabotage of the league.
        </li>
        <li>
            If any situation arises that is not covered by these rules, the commissioner will use their discretion to determine the best course of action, and enforce whatever action is necessary to maintain fair, fun, and honest play.
        </li>
        <li>
            The commissioner will act in the best interest of the league at all times.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={a_4}>A.4 General Manager Responsibilities</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Each GM shall behave in a responsible manner that would not harm other owners or the league.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is the responsibility of each GM to refrain from participating in collusion or anti-competitive behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each GM must keep their contact information updated with the commissioner and the rest of the league
        </li>
        <li>
            Each GM may only control one team in the league.
        </li>
        <li>
            Penalty for violating any GM responsibilities not outlined elsewhere in the ruleset
            <ol>
                <li>
                    1st offense: Warning
                </li>
                <li>
                    2nd offense or particularly severe incident: Loss of earliest owned rookie pick and forfeit the right to any prize winnings for the season.
                </li>
                <li>
                    3rd offense or extremely severe incident: Removed from league and forfeit the right to the team and any prize winnings

            The Inaugural Draft consists of 30 rounds, and includes both NFL veterans AND rookies that have been drafted or signed to rookie free agent contracts by NFL teams.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Inaugural draft must be scheduled to take place after the NFL rookie draft.

            Rookies and Free Agents are both available to be drafted.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rookie draft picks will be granted to all teams for the current and future seasons.
        </li>
        <li>
            The draft order is determined by the “Potential Points” ranking (the highest possible points you could have gotten), which is to prevent tanking.
        </li>
        <li>
            The rookie draft will be a long-running online draft, using the league software, starting on 1st Sunday of June at 12:00 PM EST. Owners are expected to plan around being available on this date and in the subsequent days / weeks to ensure an expeditious draft.
        </li>
        <li>
            GMs are allowed a 24 hour selection time limit. This time limit is for "just in case" scenarios and should not be abused. No one should continually hold up the draft or use the full allotted amount of time in a given round if they can help it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Teams that exceed their 24-hour selection time limit will have their pick skipped
        </li>
        <li>
            In such a scenario, it is the responsibility of the team GM to then contact the commissioners with the player they wish to select and said selection will be approved and processed if the player is still available
        </li>
        <li>
            If a GM misses two picks in a row, the draft will be stopped and the commissioner will try to contact the GM to discuss the situation.

    <h3 bind:this={f_3}>F.3 Trade Vetoing</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            This league supports the spirit of “Trades will not be vetoed, except in clear cases of collusion.” However, for the integrity and longevity of the league, there must be a mechanism to handle ‘league breaking’ trades.
        <li>
            Commissioner reserves the right to deem a trade “league breaking” and reverse said trade.
        </li>
        <li>
            The term “league breaking” is an extremely high bar, and is not to be taken lightly.
        </li>
        <li>
            This mechanism isn’t meant to handle trades where people have different player values and it isn’t intended to impose the commissioner’s player values on other people.

                    Owners may submit to the commissioner conditional lineup requests based on player availability and scheduling that makes fully informed decision making impossible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Owner’s must specify their request prior to the start of either potential players’ games, and with enough time for the commissioner to approve it before said games begin.

                <li>
                    The conditional nature is based solely on the availability of the given player or the occurrence of a game. The conditional nature cannot be based on the availability of any other player, and a player need only be available to be played - starting nor even playing a snap is required.
