After torching the league, my friend logged into my team and traded him to himself. I\u2019m somehow still friends with him. If any of you try this, however, I will pull a Liam Neeson on you.
In seriousness, fantasy has always been my favorite way to stay in touch with friends. I take it pretty seriously, and often care more about my team than the Panthers. (As you could probably tell, the heels and Tottenham are where my primary allegiances lie). I\u2019m glad to be a part of this group, look forward to hopefully kicking your asses, and more importantly hearing your trash talk in return.
May the best man win.`,photo:"/managers/jay.jpg",fantasyStart:2005,favoriteTeam:"car",mode:"Rebuild",rival:{name:"Lowballers & Anyone he loses to.",link:null,image:"/managers/everyone.png"},favoritePlayer:2133,philosophy:"Bench star players during the week to motivate better performance on the weekend.

Therapist (Carrie Fisher): Oh no, please, please, let's hear about your childhood.
Dr Evil: Very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.`,photo:"/managers/tyler.jpg",fantasyStart:2009,favoriteTeam:"nyj",mode:"Rebuild",rival:{name:"The Dirty Schnitzel",link:1,image:"/managers/rival-jj.jpg"},favoritePlayer:6806,philosophy:"Watch the Jets, then do the opposite.",tradingScale:5}];export{a,t as d,l as e,o as h,e as l,s as m};
